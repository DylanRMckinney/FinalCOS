How to run the program (command line arguments): "move" with a space and then a n, e, w, or s will "move" you on the map in that direction. Invalid direction entries will return an error. You can also save the game state with "save" and load with "load!"

Description of the program itself: I remade (more or less) the Dungeon Master project to refresh my memory, but now it has pickups, a score incrementer, and a (WIP) save/load system!

What was the “something not explicitly taught in class” ...uhhh.... shiney pickups??
